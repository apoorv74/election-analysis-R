This collection of data analysis notebooks was created to teach R. The primary objective is to showcase a few important concepts features such as [how to manage projects](https://workflowr.github.io), processing datasets with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages, using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to develop visualisations, GIS analysis through interactive maps developed using [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), etc.

Another important feature of this course is to learn the basics of [reproducible research](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html).
