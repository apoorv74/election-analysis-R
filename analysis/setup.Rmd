## Setup Instructions

To reproduce the results on your own computer, please follow these setup instructions.

1. Download or clone the git repository on your computer.
2. The raw and processed data files should be available inside the [data]() directory.
3. Install R and/or Rstudio.
4. Install the R packages used for the analyses. The [source-libraries.R]() file contains the list of all required packages. You can also install the packages manually, at once, using the code below

```{r download-missing-packages, eval=FALSE}
ipak <- function(pkg){
    new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
    if (length(new.pkg)) 
        install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}

packages <- c("tidyverse","readxl","sf","geojsonsf","leaflet","paletteer","scales","DT","knitr","kableExtra")
ipak(packages)

```

5. After completing these steps, you should be able to run the analysis.

### Note

- Please refer to the [workflowr - Getting Started](https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-01-getting-started.html) article to understand how code and analysis files are structured within the project directory.
