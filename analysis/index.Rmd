## Project Overview

This series of analysis notebook were created to deliver an R session for Data Science students. The primary objective is to showcase a few important features of the language like [how to manage projects](https://workflowr.github.io), processing datasets with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages, using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to develop visualisations, GIS analysis through interactive maps developed using [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), etc.

Another important feature of this course is to learn the basics of [reproducible research](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html). 

## Analysing the Indian Parliament Constituency (Lok Sabha) elections of 2019

For the purpose of explaining the features highlighted above, we will be using the **dataset of 2019 Indian general elections**. A few rich datasets for analysing constituencies, electors and candidates are available in the public domain. The data is collected by the [Election Commission of India](https://eci.gov.in/) and made available on the website post the elections.

Using these datasets, we'll explore data points such as:

1. [Constituencies where women voted more than men](voter-turnout-gender.html)
2. [The relationship between caste and seat distribution by political parties](caste_wise_constituencies.html)
3. [Gender distribution of candidates across constituencies](caste_wise_constituencies.html)
4. [The median age of candidates participating in an election](candidate-profile.html)
5. [Constituencies with high and low margin of votes for the winning candidate](votes-margin-analysis.html)

The above set of pages were generated by rendering the [R Markdown documents](analysis/). 
You can refer to this [link](process.html) to understand and follow the step by step process for processing the datasets for analysis. 

The constituency dataset can be explored interactively [here](explore-constituency-data.html). Use these links to download the processed datasets:
